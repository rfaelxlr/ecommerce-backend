E-commerce Backend (Learning Project)
This project is a backend for a basic e-commerce application, built for learning purposes. It utilizes the following technologies:

Java 17: The programming language for development.
Spring Boot 3.1.3: A framework for rapid application development.
PostgreSQL: The database management system for storing product, order, and other e-commerce data.
RabbitMQ: A message broker for asynchronous communication (optional, depending on your implementation).
Flyway: A database migration tool for managing schema changes.

This project is intended for educational purposes. Here's a basic guide to running it locally:

Prerequisites:
Java 17: Download and install from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.
PostgreSQL: Install a local instance of PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Consider using a tool like pgAdmin for management (https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).
RabbitMQ (Optional): Install RabbitMQ if you plan to use it for asynchronous communication (https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/download).
Database Setup:
Configure the database connection details in application.properties.
Create a database for the project (e.g., ecommerce_backend).
(Optional) Run any necessary database migration scripts using Flyway.
Project Setup:
Clone the project repository.
Ensure you have a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) configured for Spring Boot projects.
Import the project into your IDE.
Run the Application:
Run the main application class (usually EcommerceBackendApplication). This will start the Spring Boot application and connect to the database.
Functionality (Example)

This project is a basic learning example and may not have full e-commerce functionality.
